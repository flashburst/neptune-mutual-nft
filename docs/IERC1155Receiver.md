## Functions

- [onERC1155Received(address operator, address from, uint256 id, uint256 value, bytes data)](#onerc1155received)
- [onERC1155BatchReceived(address operator, address from, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values, bytes data)](#onerc1155batchreceived)

### onERC1155Received

Handles the receipt of a single ERC1155 token type. This function is
 called at the end of a `safeTransferFrom` after the balance has been updated.
 NOTE: To accept the transfer, this must return
 `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))`
 (i.e. 0xf23a6e61, or its own function selector).

```solidity
function onERC1155Received(address operator, address from, uint256 id, uint256 value, bytes data) external nonpayable
returns(bytes4)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| operator | address | The address which initiated the transfer (i.e. msg.sender) | 
| from | address | The address which previously owned the token | 
| id | uint256 | The ID of the token being transferred | 
| value | uint256 | The amount of tokens being transferred | 
| data | bytes | Additional data with no specified format | 

**Returns**

`bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))` if transfer is allowed

### onERC1155BatchReceived

Handles the receipt of a multiple ERC1155 token types. This function
 is called at the end of a `safeBatchTransferFrom` after the balances have
 been updated.
 NOTE: To accept the transfer(s), this must return
 `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))`
 (i.e. 0xbc197c81, or its own function selector).

```solidity
function onERC1155BatchReceived(address operator, address from, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values, bytes data) external nonpayable
returns(bytes4)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| operator | address | The address which initiated the batch transfer (i.e. msg.sender) | 
| from | address | The address which previously owned the token | 
| ids | uint256[] | An array containing ids of each token being transferred (order and length must match values array) | 
| values | uint256[] | An array containing amounts of each token being transferred (order and length must match ids array) | 
| data | bytes | Additional data with no specified format | 

**Returns**

`bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))` if transfer is allowed
